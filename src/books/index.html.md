# Books

In the first decade of this century I mostly read classic science fiction books
and the next decade I arrived at contemporary books. This category is what I
like the most to read while at home, a bright or dark vision of future is a
great escape to everyday life. I also enjoy some fantasy books.

When I'm traveling my mind is more free so I prefer philosophical, political,
or environmental books.
