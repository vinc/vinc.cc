# Ficus microcarpa #1

In December 2003, I bought a cheap ficus from a supermarket to restart my
bonsai collection after taking a break for a few years during high school.

## May 2004

I repotted and trunk-chopped it early in 2004. Around that time I had just
learned about akadama and biogold. I also applied my first wire to this tree.

## August 2004

I asked for styling advice on an online forum. The result wasn't pretty, but at
least I learned how to move branches. I had also defoliated the first branch
early in July.

## September 2005

I cut back hard, defoliated, and wired the whole tree in the middle of June and
it responded quite well during the summer.

## June 2006

At the end of June 2006 I only defolied and wired the first two branches and
according to my notes it responded poorly this time.

## April 2007

I repotted the tree into a mix of 80% lava and 20% akadama, too early in the
season. I put a layer of larger lava on top of the substrat for some reason.

I defoliated it again in late August 2007, which was too late in the season,
but it had a lot of natural light indoors so the reaction wasn't too bad.

## July 2010

I skipped defoliation in 2008, defoliated in July 2009, and again at the end of
July 2010.

## October 2011

After five years of cultivation, the branches were looking pretty good. The
trunk chop was almost invisible, but the lowest part of the trunk hadn't
thickened much.

## July 2020

Between 2011 and 2020, the tree was left alone in a garden without
fertilization, and overwintered in a cold greenhouse instead of indoors. It
lost all its lower branches but survived. I got it back after the first covid
lockdown and repotted it into some akadama and lava I had lying around, 13
years after the previous repotting.

## June 2021

At first it was extremely weak, and it was very easy to overwater it by
mistake. I set up a greenhouse and let it grow there during the summer.

## July 2022

After two years it was in better shape and ready for another trunk chop,
resetting it just like I had done 18 years earlier.

## July 2023

It reacted strongly to the trunk chop the previous year. I removed all the
branches I didn't need, without cutting anything back.

## May 2024

I let those branches grow for another year without intervention.

## July 2025

The lower trunk had thickened after a few years of uninterrupted growth. It was
time to cut back all the branches and repot the tree into a bonsai pot.

## December 2025

The tree reacted very well and continued to grow through the rest of the season
before moving indoors.
