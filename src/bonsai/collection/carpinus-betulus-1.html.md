# Carpinus betulus #1

## January 2005

I acquired this young European hornbeam from a local garden nursery in the
beginning of 2005. I guess it to be between 4 and 5 years old at the time.

A few weeks later, the trunk was cut after the third branch, while the second
one was reduced, and the first branch was removed. In retrospect this was a
mistake, the trunk should have been cut between the first and the second
branch, and the first branch would have provided a natural continuity of the
trunk with good tapering.

In spring the tree was then planted into the ground over a tile with some
lava added to the soil.

The third branch got really big after a year of growth in the ground but it was
starting horizontally and gave the trunk a bad shape so the trunk was reduced
again at the level of the second branch.

## February 2010

Unfortunately I can't find pictures of the previous years but the tree was left
to grow freely with just one cut at about twice the height of the previous cut.

In that time the diameter of the trunk had arrived at what I wanted so I
transplanted it into a container at the end of February 2010.

In retrospect I can identify two mistakes here: first the second cut should
have been worked on to look natural, 10 years later it's still basically the
same. And then it'd have been better to select a branch from the top to provide
the continuity of the trunk instead of this one at the bottom. But I think
there were no other available candidates at that time.

## October 2011

In the previous years I was studying at a university just a couple of hours
away from the garden of my parents where my trees were growing but I moved to
the capital of the country for work in 2011 and moved again to the other side
of the world a few years later.

## March 2017

During that time this tree got a bit forgotten in the garden, with an
occasional hedge cut when it got noticed for getting too big. It received
some water but no feeding.

## July 2020

After a couple of year I came back to this side of the world, then after
another few years my life stabilized enough to move the trees that managed to
stay alive during that period into my own garden.

This one managed pretty well, especially this year after an emergency
transplantation into a new container. It will now receive regular feedings and
lots of water during the growing season, then a structural pruning in winter,
and be repotted in spring.
