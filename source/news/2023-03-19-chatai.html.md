# Publishing Chatai

![Chatai](chatai.png)

After a few months of playing with [ChatGPT][1] I decided to have a look at the
API and write a CLI client in Ruby because the web app made by OpenAI was too
slow.

The result is [Chatai][2] and I like it a lot. It's really simple but do just
what I need.

```
$ chatai
> What is Unix?
Unix is a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system that was first
developed in the 1960s. It is known for its stability, security, and
flexibility, and is widely used in servers, workstations, and embedded
systems. Unix is based on the concept of a shell, which allows users to
interact with the system through a command-line interface or graphical
user interface. It also has a rich set of standard utilities and tools
that make it easy to perform various tasks such as file management,
process management, networking, and more. Unix has many variants,
including Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and macOS.

> Who wrote it?
Unix was initially written by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others
at Bell Labs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

> List 5 contributors
1. Ken Thompson
2. Dennis Ritchie
3. Brian Kernighan
4. Steve Bourne
5. Doug McIlroy
```

I published the gem on [RubyGems][3] and the code on [GitHub][4].
